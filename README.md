# Caponi Art Park

The Caponi Art Park application uses geolocation to allow park users to find their position in the park. It allows them to click on markers to pull up detailed information on park sculptures and associated poetry, wriing, and anecdotes connected to the park. Some location markers are designed to only appear when the park guest comes in proximity of the statue. This allows users to discover new and in depth information that was previously unavailable. Along with the map, the application allows guest to see the schdule of events happening in the park, as well as submit their email for further information and newsletters. 
On the administrative side, this application allows the user to set a marker within the park, and designate whether the marker will be a static (displayed consistantly) or a proximity (only displays when a guest is within a certain range) marker. They can then add supporting information to the marking, such as a main photograph, general descriptions, and supporting writings, anecdotes, and poems. The administrator can also manage park events, users, and basic park guidelines.
